### SCRIPTS FOUND IN /enadisk/maison/morlon/stage/script/ ###

### orthologs_analysis_test.R 
modified version of the heatmap script - not relevant

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis.R 
Perform a GO enrichment of one cluster previously generated by Martinfrom OrthoInspector results using clusterProfiler
Input a single seq_cluster.txt

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2.R 
Perform a GO enrichment of each cluster previously generated by Martinfrom OrthoInspector results using clusterProfiler
NEW:
- Inputs an entire directory
- Outputs to a given directory the results of the analysis .rds and the barplot figure .svg 
- Added cluster size
- Organism name now defined in the script (line 74)
- Added instructions at the start 
Known issue(s):
- When attempting to draw an svg from an enrichResults object with no significant terms, outputs an empty .nfs file into the directory

### compare_cluster.R
Load each previously created cluster into a compareClusterResult object for various representation
- single dotplot including each cluster
- gene-concept network (cnetplot)
- pvalue distribution

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot.R
Same as clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2.R but outputs dotplots

### topgo_go_enrichment_analysis.R
Perform a GO enrichment of clusters generated by Martinfrom OrthoInspector results using topGO, returns an heatmap
- faster than previous scripts
- choose type of GO term (BP / CC / MF)
- takes into account hierarchical go annotation !
- multiple visualization possible
- multiple parameters for heatmap visualization

# Remarks
I tried using the `enrichGO()` function with no success so far, an OrgDb object may (?) theoretically be created for each organism but it is time consuming and rather complicated
