### SCRIPTS FOUND IN /enadisk/maison/morlon/stage/script/ ###

### orthologs_analysis_test.R 
Modified version of the heatmap script - **not relevant**

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis.R 
SCRIPT: Perform a GO enrichment of one cluster previously generated by Martinfrom OrthoInspector results using clusterProfiler
Input a single seq_cluster.txt

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2.R
SCRIPT: same as clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot but displays a barplot

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot.R
SCRIPT: same as clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot_function.R not encapsulated in function 

### clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot_function.R 
FUNCTION: Perform a GO enrichment of **each cluster** previously generated by Martinfrom OrthoInspector results using clusterProfiler
- Inputs an entire directory
- Outputs to a given directory the results of the analysis .rds and the barplot figure .svg 
- Added cluster size
- Encapsulated in function
- choose cutoff pval, adjust pval method
- choose to plot or only to save rds
Known issue(s):
- When attempting to draw an svg from an enrichResults object with no significant terms, outputs an empty .nfs file into the directory

### compare_cluster.R
FUNCTION: Load each previously created cluster into a compareClusterResult object for various representation
- single dotplot including each cluster
- gene-concept network (cnetplot)
- pvalue distribution

> clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot_function.R and compare_cluster.R can be run in a wrapper script if necessary.
>>#### Option 1:
>- Call the desired function in both scripts.
>- Create a writer script that calls each script one by one using `source(clusterprofiler_go_enrichment_analysis_v2_dotplot_function.R)` and then `source(compare_cluster.R)`.
>
>>#### Option 2:
>- Call both scripts only to define the `profiler_go_analysis` and `compare_cluster` functions.
>- Call those functions with the desired parameters.


### topgo_go_enrichment_analysis.R
SCRIPT: prototype of topgo_go_enrichment_analysis_v2.R, multiple visualization methods available from line 90 to 118

### topgo_go_enrichment_analysis_v2.R
FUNCTION: Performs GO enrichment of clusters generated by Martinfrom OrthoInspector results using topGO, returns an heatmap
- faster than previous scripts
- choose algorithm 
- choose type of GO term (BP / CC / MF)
- choose p-value limit
- choose top nb of enriched GO terms to keep per cluster
- takes into account hierarchical go annotation
- multiple visualization possible
- multiple parameters for heatmap visualization
Known issue(s):
- "classic" algorithm not working

### annotate_id.sh
SCRIPT: Executable bash script, takes a b2g file with RepID as input, resulting file name as output. adds corresponding gene name and UniProt/RefSeq access separated by a tabulation for each line with a RepId

# Remarks
I tried using the `enrichGO()` of clusterProfiler with no success so far, an OrgDb object may theoretically be created for each organism but it necessitate a .b2g file with UniProt names as GO_ID
